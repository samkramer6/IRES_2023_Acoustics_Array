function time_indeces = freq_domain_finder(data,fs,FM_chirp,CFFM_chirp)
%
%   This is a function that is going to be used to find the chirps from the
%   data using the frequency domain in contrast to the time domain. This
%   uses both the CFFM_chirp and the FM_chirp that are created by the main
%   function script. This uses a cross-spectrogram analysis to find the
%   peaks.
